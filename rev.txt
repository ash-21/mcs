Bong's opening and climactic scenes, in which the old woman bops around to a dance tune amid a vast field of yellow grass, are typical of the movie's cockeyed poetry.
Bold, unpredictable and quietly devastating, Mother is Bong's first masterpiece.
You've never met a mother quite like this one.
It is Hye-ja Kim that carries Mother, making her mother of a Mother an all-suffering, all-enduring victim who acquires more spine and subtler shadings as the story deliberately, patiently reveals its secrets.
Disturbing, enthralling and filled with interesting shots that reflect an artist's eye.
